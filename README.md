# CT-overfitting-metric

ct.py must be modified to use correct paths to generated samples. Put each set of generated images in path1, path2, etc, and then modify the "paths" array to include the correct number of paths. Each path is a tuple
containing the path to the sample, and the independent variable being tested. 
Command to run:
```bash
python3 ct.py
```
